During the coronavirus pandemic, I am making a concerted effort to improve my data science and visualization skills. In light of this effort, I am practicing D3.js in earnest.

The best resource to learn D3.js that I have seen, thus far, seems to be [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web]() by [Scott Murray]. It has some great examples, and works through d3 at a pace far slower than some of the online courses that I have encountered. I highly recommend it.

I've adapted some of the bar chart sections from this book, and added a random dataset number generator, to continuously update bar charts upon clicks. Check it out by clicking on the text.
