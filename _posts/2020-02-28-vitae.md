Hi. My name is Niko, a PhD student in Bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu).  I work in [Rob Phillips’](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) lab.

I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked with [Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.ledesma-amaro/) and [Tom Ellis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ellis/) on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from the [University of Iowa](https://www.uiowa.edu/), where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with [E. Dale Abel](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/e-dale-abel).

My top five books right now:

-Rome's Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar by Soni & Goodman

-Where the Sea Breaks Its Back by Corey Ford

-Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl

-Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton by Richard Westfall

-Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age by W. Bernard Carlson

Research:
Graduate Student, Caltech, PI: Rob Phillips 2018-present

Masters Student, Imperial College, PIs: Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro & Tom Ellis 2017-2018
-Project: Control of metabolic flux in yeast and assembly systems for the multiplexing of gRNAs in vivo.

Co-Founder/Co-Leader, Iowa iGEM 2017
-Project: Development of a biosensor for direct 3-hydroxypropionate detection in B. subtilis. 
-First iGEM team from the University of Iowa. As a team of 12 students, we fundraised $17k, set up a lab space and developed a biosensor.  A lab course is now offered by our faculty mentors in synthetic biology, the first of its kind on campus.

Undergraduate Research Assistant, PI: E. Dale Abel, MD, PhD, 2013-2017
-Project 1: Elucidate the mechanism by which heart failure occurs in mice lacking Insulin Receptor Substrates (IRS) 1 and 2
-Project 2: Determine the mechanism by which murine cardiomyocyte glucose transporter expression is regulated in the context of a high-fat diet
