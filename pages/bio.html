<h3>Hi.</h3>
My name is Niko, a PhD student in <a href="https://www.be.caltech.edu/">Bioengineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a>. I work in <a href="https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/">Rob Phillips'</a> group, where I am exploring the interface of biophysics and evolution.<br><br>

I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.ledesma-amaro">Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ellis">Tom Ellis</a> on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/biochemistry/">Biochemistry</a> from the <a href="https://uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>, where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/e-dale-abel">E. Dale Abel</a>.<br><br>

I am a voracious reader and enjoy digging into my research data with Python, using mathematical models to guide my thinking.<br><br>
