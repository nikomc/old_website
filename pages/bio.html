Hi. My name is Niko, a PhD student in Bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu).  I work in [Rob Phillipsâ€™](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) lab.

I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked with [Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.ledesma-amaro/) and [Tom Ellis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ellis/) on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from the [University of Iowa](https://www.uiowa.edu/), where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with [E. Dale Abel](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/e-dale-abel).
