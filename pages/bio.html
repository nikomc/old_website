<h3>Hi.</h3>
My name is Niko, a PhD student in <a href="">Bioengineering</a> at the <a href="">California Institute of Technology</a>. I work in <a href="">Rob Phillips'</a> group, where I am exploring the interface of biophysics and evolution.<br><br>

I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from <a href="">Imperial College London</a>, where I worked with <a href="">Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro</a> and <a href="">Tom Ellis</a> on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in <a href="">Biochemistry</a> from the <a href="">University of Iowa</a>, where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/e-dale-abel">E. Dale Abel</a>.<br><br>

I am a voracious reader and enjoy digging into my research data with Python, using mathematical models to guide my thinking.<br><br>
