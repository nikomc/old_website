The coronavirus outbreak has been a trying time. I'm obviously not an epidemiologist, or a virologist, or any other profession that anyone should turn to for advice in the weeks to come. I don't have insights or words of wisdom to offer, except "Listen to the experts". I'm just a scientist that is interested in viruses -- especially their remarkable ability to pack a _huge_ punch in a tiny little capsule, a feature that we are all observing in real time.<p>

I hope that you enjoyed this brief exploration of viral information storage. All of my Jupyter notebooks can be found in one of my [GitHub](https://github.com/nikomc/Interactives_Python) repositories.
