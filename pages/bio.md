Hi. My name is Niko, a PhD student in Bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).  I work in Rob Phillipsâ€™ lab.

I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from Imperial College London, where I worked with Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro and Tom Ellis on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Iowa, where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with E. Dale Abel.
