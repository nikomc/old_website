Hi. My name is Niko, a PhD student in Bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology [Caltech] (https://www.caltech.edu/). I work in [Rob Phillips’] (https://www.rpgroup.pboc.com/) lab.

I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from Imperial College London, where I worked with Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro and Tom Ellis on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Iowa, where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with E. Dale Abel.

My top five books right now:

-Rome’s Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar by Soni & Goodman

-Where the Sea Breaks Its Back by Corey Ford

-Man’s Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl

-Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton by Richard Westfall

-Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age by W. Bernard Carlson
