Research:
Graduate Student, Caltech, PI: Rob Phillips 2018-present

Masters Student, Imperial College, PIs: Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro & Tom Ellis 2017-2018
-Project: Control of metabolic flux in yeast and assembly systems for the multiplexing of gRNAs in vivo.

Co-Founder/Co-Leader, Iowa iGEM 2017
-Project: Development of a biosensor for direct 3-hydroxypropionate detection in B. subtilis. 
-First iGEM team from the University of Iowa. As a team of 12 students, we fundraised $17k, set up a lab space and developed a biosensor.  A lab course is now offered by our faculty mentors in synthetic biology, the first of its kind on campus.

Undergraduate Research Assistant, PI: E. Dale Abel, MD, PhD, 2013-2017
-Project 1: Elucidate the mechanism by which heart failure occurs in mice lacking Insulin Receptor Substrates (IRS) 1 and 2
-Project 2: Determine the mechanism by which murine cardiomyocyte glucose transporter expression is regulated in the context of a high-fat diet
